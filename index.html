              <b>Short Academic Journey</b>
            <p>I've done my matric from a Icon Public School Barikot, Swat. Then I did my fsc from one of the most famous postgraduate colleges in Swat
              which is Government Pstgraduate Jahanzeb college Saidu Sharif, Swat. I left my field,medical, for my interest, computer science, and in few
              years I see myself as a cybersecurity expert and a certified ethical hacker.
               In the first year of my Bs Computer Science I studied C++ and Java but my interest govened in cybersecurity due to one of my subjects
              ,<b>Networking</b> , and then I started gaining some skills in the field of cyber security by starting from deep study of networks,
                 linux and python.</p>
              <b>Experience</b>
                 <p>I have worked in Microsoft as an intern for 3 months during summer break of university and I have also worked in other IT companies for a short span of time.
                  But now I am focused on building a cybersecurity firm.

                  <dd>There is always a demand for quality job boards. If you have some technical skills already, starting a job web page of your own is
                    a great idea for a side project that can help you bring in some extra income. For this purpose I have developed a website which suites for 
                   your side hustle. I have used Django framework to build this website.</dd>

                    <dd>Quite a few platforms out there will host online courses for you. But they come at a price. I have developed a free website which offers courses 
                      free of cost and are beginner friendly.In this website I have used <b>MERN</b> stack.
